# Idea
## Theme: Extremely Incohesive Fever Dream

brain storming:
- Surreal
- different mediums(stop motion, lego, clay, paper, fotos)
- needs to be 2d(idk how to make 3d for now)
- fever dream games:
    - hylics
    - ena dream bbq
    - no I'm not human
    - The Exit 8
    - MiSide
    - Pumkin Panic
    - Smile for me
    - poco


- horror game?
- shaders (dont know how to make)
- maybe an rpg like hylics
- needs to be simple small(no fancy mechanics)
- multiple worlds
- maybe multiple characters
- interesting npcs
- maybe playing an object
- hallucinations
- ghosts
- 

- Art is very important
- important unusual context(like using a hammer to spread butter on bread)
- unexpected stuff


game Ideas:
- a game like hylics in a surreal world
- cooking game where everything you cook wirder and wirder stuff
- fotografy game? (interesting)
- elevator game (playing always diffrent people trying to get to other floors or some one being stuck in one floor or some one stuck in a time loop) (and strange things just keep hapening)
- maybe somthing like papers pls
- a point and click detective game?
- uh a surreal little to the left would be also interesting
- 

final game Idea:
A Cooking game(more like an Ice cream game)
in a point and click style
